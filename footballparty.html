        <strong>A VERY SPECIAL FOOTBALL PARTY</strong><br>
        <strong>W/ SLOW POKE FOOD PROJECT</strong><br>
        <strong>SUNDAY FEBRUARY 11th</strong><br>
        <strong>5 PM</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Join your pals at Decoy Bar on Sunday February 11th to watch a very special football game and enjoy a cornucopia of delicious snacks prepared by Slow Poke Food Project!</p>

      <p>We were blown away by the food Slow Poke prepared for our Great Lakes tap feature in December, and we're very excited to have them back in the house for this event. We'll be offering $20 pitchers of Great Lakes Lager, bourbon cocktails and pickleback shots!</p>
      
      <p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
      
      <p>Q: What is the menu and how much food will there be?</p>

      <p>A: While we hesitate to use the phrase “all-you-can-eat” lest it conjure associations with the shitty buffets of our youth, food will be served family style and you will not leave hungry. Food will come out in 4-6 different waves as it’s ready throughout the game.</p> 

      <p>Q: Ok but what is the menu going to be?</p>

      <p>A: Slow Poke will be rolling out the menu on <a href="http://www.instagram.com/slowpokefood" target="_blank"><strong>social media</strong></a> as we get closer to the game. Think fun party foods that you eat with your hands.</p>

      <p>Q: I’m a vegetarian that yearns to watch A Very Special Football Game. Will there be stuff for me to eat?</p>

      <p>A. Yes! Just make sure to let us know you’re vegetarian when you RSVP.</p>

      <p>Q: How much does it cost?</p>

      <p>A: $50 + HST ($56.50). This price includes all your food. Drinks are purchased at the bar.</p> 

      <p>Q: How do I reserve a spot?</p>

      <p>A: E-mail <a href="mailto: decoytoronto@gmail.com"><strong>decoytoronto@gmail.com</strong></a> to secure a spot. Note that space is limited and we will be closed to the public on this date.</p>
