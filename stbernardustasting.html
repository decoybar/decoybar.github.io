      <p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>

      <p>The brewery now known as St. Bernardus was established in the 1940s to brew the Trappist beers of nearby Saint-Sixtus Abbey (aka Westvleteren) under license. When its agreement with Westvleteren ended in 1992, the brewery began marketing its products under the St. Bernardus name. Efforts to revitalize the brand and its operations began in the late 90s, and demand from consumers grew steadily in subsequent years. Beers produced by St. Bernardus are now regarded as some of the best and most authentic representations of distinctive Belgian styles.</p>

      <p><strong>HOSTS</strong></p>

      <p>Kyle Osland of Horizon Beers (a specialty importer) will be in the house to answer questions relating to Belgian brewing and the beers of St. Bernardus. Horizon works closely with Belgian brewers to bring their beers to the Canadian market.
      </p>

      <p>Cheese selections were made by Nicole Pinch, a Certified Cheese Professional who began working as a mozz maker six years ago and now helms the Salumi e Formaggi department at Eataly. Nicole will be on hand to discuss the attributes of these cheeses which make them particularly well-suited to pairing with Belgian beer.</p>
