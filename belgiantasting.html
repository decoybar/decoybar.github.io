      <p><strong>MONDAY JULY 17th</strong><br>
      <strong>7-9 PM</strong></p>
      <p>For many beer enthusiasts (ourselves included), Belgian beers were a gateway to a world of exciting flavours that we never realized were attainable with brewing. To say we’re huge fans of Belgian brewing tradition would be an understatement.</p>
      <p>That’s why we’re pleased to invite you to a guided Belgian beer tasting led by Horizon Beers on July 17th! Horizon is an importer of highly sought after beverages, many of which are difficult to source without traveling to their country of origin.</p>
      <p>Through this tasting and accompanying slide show, you’ll discover the stories of the Trappist monks whose dedication to traditional brewing practices is embodied in every bottle they produce. You’ll learn about Belgian farmhouse ales, hoppy styles and more!</p>
      <p>FEATURED BEERS:
        <ul>
          <li>Orval (welcome beer)</li>
          <li>Tynt Meadow (newest Trappist)</li>
