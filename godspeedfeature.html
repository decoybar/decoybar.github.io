        <strong>AN EVENING WITH GODSPEED BREWERY</strong><br>
        <strong>SATURDAY FEBRUARY 24th</strong><br>
        <strong>6 PM</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Godspeed is your favourite brewery's favourite brewery. They were an anomaly when they opened in July 2017 near an unassuming corner on Toronto's east side, without a dank IPA on their menu, but once you tasted their beer, it was easy to understand why they inspired awe among fellow brewers. Their mastery of traditional styles, particularly German lagers, their restrained approach to incorporating Japanese ingredients, and brewmaster Luc Lafontaine's experience brewing in Japan and at Dieu de Ciel in Montreal really set them apart.</p>
      <p>In recent years, their extreme commitment to the brewing processes and techniques used to create authentic Czech-style lagers has cemented their reputation as one of the country's most unique and technically proficient breweries.</p>
      <p>Join us for an evening with the Godspeed team on February 24th and taste the fruits of their 'struggle and love'!</p>
      <p>See below for a list of kegs and cans we'll have on hand, and take note: we'll be tapping a nitro keg of Dieu de Ciel's Péché Mortel - which was brewed at Godspeed last year in collaboration with DDC brewmaster and co-founder JF. This was the first and only time this world-renowned imperial coffee stout has ever been brewed anywhere other than Dieu de Ciel, and we can't wait to taste it after a year of aging.</p>
